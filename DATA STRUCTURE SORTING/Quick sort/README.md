```
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions
the array into two parts—elements smaller than the pivot and elements larger than the pivot—and
then recursively sorts the two partitions. This process continues until the entire array becomes
sorted.
```
Here is the quick sort
```
Quick sort is based on the divide and concate technique
complete array divided into subarrays .i.e partitioning
partitioning array is backbone of the quick sort.
               partition1 <pivot < partition 2
               |          |       |           |
```
