Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element,
partitioning the array into two subarrays—one containing elements smaller than the pivot and
the other containing elements greater—then recursively sorting the subarrays. It provides an
 average time complexity of O(n log n).
